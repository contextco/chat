# SideKick ðŸ¥¾ By Context.ai
SideKick ðŸ¥¾ is an open source LLM and RAG chat product that provides similar features to both Glean and ChatGPT - but self-hosted

**SideKick ðŸ¥¾ provides:**
- A best-in-class frontend to query an LLM, with conversation history, voice support, and model selection. Similar to ChatGPT, just private.
- Connectors to RAG across data sources including Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, and more. Similar to Glean, just private.
- Total data privacy. Run SideKick with a self-hosted open source LLM for the ultimate in privacy, or use AWS Bedrock / GCP Vertex / Azure OpenAI to retain data within your private cloud
- XXX license for all core features, with a paid license only required for features contained in our Enterprise directory
